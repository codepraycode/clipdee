*Last updated: August 21, 2025*

## Overview

ClipDee is a privacy-focused Firefox extension that helps you get word definitions from your clipboard. This policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information We Collect

**None.** ClipDee does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

## What ClipDee Does

- **Reads clipboard**: Only when you click the extension icon
- **Sends words to dictionary API**: Only the specific word being looked up
- **No tracking**: We don't track your usage, history, or behavior
- **No storage**: We don't save any data about you or your searches

## Third-Party Services

ClipDee uses the Free Dictionary API (dictionaryapi.dev) to fetch word definitions. When you look up a word:

- Only the word itself is sent to their API
- No personal information is included
- We recommend reviewing their privacy policy at <https://dictionaryapi.dev>

## Permissions Explained

- **Network access**: To fetch definitions from the dictionary API
- **No other permissions**: We only request what's absolutely necessary

## Data Storage

ClipDee stores **no data** on your device or anywhere else. Each lookup is independent with no history retained.

## Your Control
